          Welcome to footybattles, the only place you'll ever need to compare
          the statistics of all of your favourite football players. Footybattles
          uses the SportScore API in order to fetch the desired player's
          statistics and other basic information about the player; and then
          displays it on the scorecard of that particular player. The idea
          behind creating footybattles came originated from my building's common
          area, where all of my friends usually hang out. Since most of us are
          football (soccer) fans, our conversations would usually end up with
          who amongst all of our favourite players is the best. As there was no
          end to this debate, I thought maybe I could create a website that that
          would compare our favourite players based on their actual statistics.
          And this is how I ended up with Footybattles!. PS: we still fight
          about who's the best from time to time, but to a lot less extent now
          :)
