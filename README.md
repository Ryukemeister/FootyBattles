Welcome to footybattles, the only place you'll ever need to compare the statistics of all your favourite football players. Footybattles uses the SportScore API in order to fetch the desired player's statistics and other basic information about the player; and then displays it on the scorecard of that particular player. Footybattles was inspired by the common area in my building, where all of my friends usually hang out. Almost all of us are football fans, so our conversations usually end up with who is the best among all of our favourites. This debate seemed to have no end, so I thought maybe I could build a website comparing our favourite players based on their actual statistics. And this is how Footybattles was born!
