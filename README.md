# Let the battles begin

Welcome to footybattles, the only place you'll ever need to compare the statistics of all of your favourite players in order to decide who is the best. The idea behind creating footybattles came to life in my building's common area, where we all usually hang out. Since most of us are football(soccer) fans, the converstaion would usually end up with who amongst our favourite players is the best. And since there were no end to this debate, I thought maybe I can create a website that compares our favourite players based on their actual statistics instead of just hypothetically comparing them based on their human qualities. And this is how I ended up with Footybattles !. PS: we stil fight about who's the best from time to time, but to a lot less extent now :)
