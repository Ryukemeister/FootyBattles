# Let the battles begin

Welcome to footybattles, the only place you'll ever need to compare the statistics of all of your favourite players in order to decide who is the best. Footybattles uses the SportScore API in order to fetch the desired player's statistics and the other basic information about the player; and then displays it on the scorecard for that particular player. The idea behind creating footybattles came to life in my building's common area, where we all usually hang out. Since most of us are football(soccer) fans, our conversations would usually end up with who amongst all of our favourite players is the best. As there was no end to this debate, I thought maybe I could create a website that that would compare our favourite players based on their actual statistics. And this is how I ended up with Footybattles!. PS: we still fight about who's the best from time to time, but to a lot less extent now :)
