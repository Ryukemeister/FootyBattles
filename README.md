# Let the battles begin

Welcome to footybattles, the only place you'll ever need to compare the statistics of all of your favourite players in order to decide who is the best. The idea behind creating footybattles came to life in my building's common area, where all of my friends usually gather around for hanging out in the evenings. Since most of us are football(soccer) fans, the converstaion would usually end up with how are current teams faring at the moment and what player is in form, and least but not the least, who's the best amongst all. Since there were no end to our discussions, I thought maybe we create a website that compare our favourite players instead of just hypothetically compare them based on their human qualities. And this is how I ended up with Footybattles in one of my github repository. PS: we still fight about who's the best from time to time, but to a lot less extent now :)
